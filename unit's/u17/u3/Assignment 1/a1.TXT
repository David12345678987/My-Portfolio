My explanation for design choices
I have chosen to have a separate page for contacting me, learn about me and know my qualifications. Having a separate page for each qualification makes it clearer to find them. Having buttons to all the pages at the top makes it clear to see and to navigate.
I have chosen blue and grey colour scheme because it has a nice contrast and with white text on buttons and the top bar it is easy to see everything. The reason I have chosen to put an image in is because the page will be very bland with just plain colours so it makes it more interesting for the viewer.

Design justification

The design solution that I have chosen fulfils its stated purpose by being easy for viewers to see my skills, qualifications and to contact me if they are interested in employing me.
The colour and text work well because it isn't glaring or hard to read and it's not boring or dull by having a turquoise header at the top. The clear separation to the rest of the page with the grey bar helps visually.
