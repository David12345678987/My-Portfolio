Comparison
The two websites I am comparing our YouTube and LCSC. The obvious differences are that LCSC is an ecommerce website then YouTube is an entertainment and media site. LCSC and YouTube both use similar forms of features like hotspots buttons and logging features all the LCSC does not have the ability to add comments to his products although this isn't really necessary.

strengths and weaknesses of LCSC
The strengths of LCSC ah it is easy to navigate and has many features like links to data sheets and part numbers which make it easier to use the site. LCSC also has nice designs and navigation with nice images with consistent backgrounds so you can see the size of the item that you're buying.
the weaknesses of LCSC that date it's hard for new people to navigate site and can be complicated for an experienced user. Another weakness is it the search bar will only show a result if you search a part number and not a general product.

Overall I would rate LCSC as a 7 out of 10
I would improve LCSC by creating easier navigation. and I would add the capabilities for searching for general products and not just part numbers.

strengths and weaknesses of YouTube 
The strengths of YouTube are that it is easy to navigate and use for people from many age groups and disabilities. and it's very entertaining and can be very useful for education at sharing information. And it's use of media and navigation, at the way it allows for feedback and communication between different uses of the site.
The weaknesses of YouTube are that it no longer shows the number of dislikes on the dislike button and the algorithm can demonetise videos for no reason, although there aren't really any other weaknesses to YouTube.

Overall I would rate YouTube as a 7 out of 10
I would improve YouTube by adding the viewing of the not a tear of dislikes on the dislike button.
