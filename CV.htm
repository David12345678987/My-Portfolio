    <br>
    My name is David Haagensen and I have a wide variety of skills with engineering and problem solving, I enjoy taking things apart and creating new and innovative designs. 
    
    <br><br>
    <t>Education: </t>
    <br>
    I have just finished my first-year of level 3 electrical and electronic engineering at Gloucestershire College in Cheltenham.  I received an achievement award this year for my work. 
    
    I studied level 2 computing at Gloucestershire College from 2022 to 2023 and received an achievement award for that year, and graduated with a merit. I also did my English and math GCSEs alongside my computing course and got a 5 in both of these. 
    
    Before this I was homeschooled and have qualifications in martial arts and participated in gymnastics, tennis and table tennis. At home I was taught maths and English, religious studies and some biology, history and German.  
    
    <br><br>
    <t>Work Experience: </t>
    <br>

    I have worked with my father from a young age doing many forms of building and carpentry. I've helped him in his building business with brickwork, carpentry, landscaping; and on our small farm I have been helping him build a barn, including laying blocks, carpentry and putting on a cement fibre roof. This involved working in a team with my friends and being a leader of the construction process. 
    
    I also have had experience with gardening and land management like grass cutting and caring for animals. 
    <br><br>
    <t>Electrical skills </t>
    <br>
    
    I have learned quite a lot about electronics from teaching myself and my own experience over the years and I enjoy soldering and wiring up circuits. I have converted my bedroom into a workshop for electrical and electronic work. And I have a 3D printer, soldering station, and power supply as well as testing equipment for my electrical work. I like taking apart and repairing broken tech as well, and have fixed Things like radios phones and much more for friends using my workshop. 
    
    In my electrical engineering course, I have learned more about the theory of electronics, like semiconductors and how to use different formulas and a little bit on the function of circuits and the theory behind how they work. 
    
     Using these electrical skills, I've done many projects like building a 3D printed robot arm using commercially available servos for remote control vehicles with a 3D printed frame controlled from an Arduino. 
    
    I have also worked on building an electronically operated door and I was able to link it up using a ESP32 to the internet so I could control it remotely. 
    
    I also built a small solar system on my parents' house for lighting downstairs, which uses a solar panel and a car battery wired up with a charge controller connected to some lighting. 
    <br><br>
    <t>Computer skills </t>
    <br>
    
    In my computer course I learned a lot about how computers are built and some uses of them like video editing or website development. I also have done a small amount of coding microcontrollers and other coding projects. 
    
    I have worked on my own computer repairing and upgrading it and have had experience at home and in college in this area. 
    <br><br>
    <t>Language skills  </t>
    <br>
    
    In my English GCSEs I got a 5, I had access arrangements for some of my assessments but my language skills have been improving from help at college.
