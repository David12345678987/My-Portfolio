    <br>
    My name is David Haagensen and I have a wide variety of skills in engineering and problem solving. I enjoy taking things apart and creating new and innovative designs. 
    
    <br><br>
    <t style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">Education </t>
    <br>


I have finished my first-year of EAL Level 3 Technical Extended Diploma in Engineering Technologies · (2023 - 2025) at Gloucestershire College in Cheltenham.  I received an achievement award this year for my work.
<br>
I have completed a BTEC, Level 2 computing, at Gloucestershire College from 2022 to 2023 and received an achievement award for that year, and graduated with a merit merit. I also did my English and Maths GCSE (GCSE, AQA English language · (2022 - 2023) Grade: 5 GCSE, AQA Mathematics · (2022 - 2023) Grade: 5) At college and gained a 5 in both, the highest possible mark as the college offered the lower tier for both. I am dyslexic and received access arrangements for English. In my computer course I learnt how computers are built and some uses of them like video editing or website development. I also have done a small amount of coding microcontrollers and other coding projects. 
<br>
I have worked on my own computer, repairing and upgrading it, and have had experience at home and in college in this area. 

<br><br>

Before this I was homeschooled and was taught Maths, English, Physics and other sciences, German, History, Religious studies and Art. I also achieved a Blue tag belt in Taekwando and had gymnastic and tennis lessons. 

    <br><br>
    <t style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">Work Experience </t>
    <br>

    I have worked with my father, a self-employed builder, from a young age doing many forms of building and carpentry. I've helped him in his building business with brickwork, carpentry, landscaping. On our small farm I have been helping him build a barn, including laying blocks, carpentry and putting on a cement fibre roof. This involved working in a team with my friends and being a leader of the construction process.  

    I also have experience growing fruit and vegetables in my own plot, managing orchard trees, grass cutting and caring for my family's flock of sheep. 
    <br><br>

    <t style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">Electrical and engineering skills</t>
    <br>
    
In my electrical engineering course, I have learned more about the theory of electronics, like semiconductors and how to use different formulas and a little bit on the function of circuits and the theory behind how they work. In my second year I've done a bit of CAD and developing a project. 
    <br><br>
Before college I learnt about electronics from educational videos online, which have helped me to gain practical experience with building projects and working with electronics. In my early teenage years, I converted my bedroom into a workshop for electrical and electronic work. And I have a 3D printer, soldering station, and power supply as well as testing equipment for my projects. I like taking apart broken technical equipment and repairing it and have fixed many items for friends such as radios, phones and much more using my workshop. 
       
Using these electrical skills, I've done many projects like building a 3D printed robot arm, using commercially available servos for remote control vehicles, with a 3D printed frame, I designed the frame in fusion 360, In college I'm learning on SolidWorks, But for my personal projects I use fusion. And the robot arm was controlled from an Arduino Nano.

I have also worked on building an electronically operated door opening and closing mechanism and I was able to link it up using a ESP32 to the internet so I could control it remotely. 

I also built a small solar system on my parents' house for lighting downstairs, which uses a solar panel and a car battery wired up with a charge controller connected to some lighting. 

    <br><br>
    <t style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;">Sports and other Activities  </t>
    <br>
    
    I belong to the Cheltenham Table Tennis Club and in addition to attending weekly training sessions, play in local league competitions. I also enjoy running and hill climbing and I have done the Welsh Three Peaks challenge with a group of friends from church, Providence Baptist Chapel in Cheltenham, which I regularly attend with my family.
